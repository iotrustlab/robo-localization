- Write unit tests BEFORE implementing functionality
- Tests must verify mathematical correctness, not curve-fit to specific outputs
- Use pytest fixtures for sensor data generation
- Test edge cases: sensor dropouts, high noise, initialization
- Verify coordinate frame transformations with known values
- Assert filter convergence properties, not exact numerical outputs
- If tests fail, fix the implementation logic, never adjust test expectations
