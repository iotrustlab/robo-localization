- Use numpy arrays for all numerical computations
- Avoid loops for matrix operations - use vectorized operations
- Use scipy.linalg for matrix decompositions and inversions
- Add shape assertions for matrix operations
- Use descriptive variable names for matrices (P_cov, H_jacobian)
- Handle numerical edge cases (matrix inversion, sqrt of negatives)
